# Windsor.ai Plugin for Claude Code

Manage and analyze Google Ads, Meta Ads, Instagram, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads and Microsoft Ads from Claude Code through [Windsor.ai](https://windsor.ai). The same install reads GA4, Search Console, HubSpot, Salesforce, Shopify, Stripe, QuickBooks and 350+ other sources.

## What This Plugin Does

- **Report on ad accounts:** campaigns, ad groups, keywords, search terms, quality score, impression share, spend, conversions and cost per conversion, across one platform or several at once
- **Report on Instagram:** post reach, saves, engagement and follower growth
- **Make changes after you confirm:** pause or enable campaigns, change budgets, set Google Ads bids and bidding strategies, create Google Ads campaigns and responsive search ads, push negative keywords, publish Instagram posts, carousels, reels and stories, and reply to, hide or delete Instagram comments
- **Combine sources:** ad spend next to GA4 sessions, CRM deals or Shopify orders
- **Use the data in code:** seed dashboards, generate fixtures and TypeScript types, build data pipelines

Claude shows every change and waits for your yes before it runs. New Google Ads and Meta Ads campaigns, ad groups, ad sets and ads are created paused by default, and new LinkedIn Ads creatives are created as drafts.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sign-in fails or tools stop responding:** clear the Windsor.ai authentication in Claude Code (`/mcp`, select `windsor-ai`, re-authenticate) and sign in again.
- **A connector shows no accounts:** connect the account in Windsor.ai first at [onboard.windsor.ai](https://onboard.windsor.ai), then run `/windsor-sources`.
- **Instagram comments return a permission error:** the account was connected before comment access was added. Reconnect it in Windsor.ai.
- **A field is rejected:** field names differ by connector. Ask Claude to check them with `get_fields`, or run `/windsor-sources`.
- **Anything else:** email [support@windsor.ai](mailto:support@windsor.ai).

## Privacy

The plugin contains no hooks and no local code. Claude Code sends requests to Windsor.ai's MCP server at `mcp.windsor.ai`, which reads data from, and makes approved changes on, the platforms you have connected in Windsor.ai. Windsor.ai processes these requests under its [Privacy Policy](https://windsor.ai/privacy-policy/).
