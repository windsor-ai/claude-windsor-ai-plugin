# Google Business Profile via Windsor.ai

The connector id is `google_my_business`. It covers the user's own Google Business Profile locations: performance, reviews, local posts and photos, and listing management. It has no ad or website search data; Google Ads (`google_ads`) and Search Console (`searchconsole`) are separate connectors.

Write actions today are `create_local_post`, `update_local_post`, `reply_to_review`, `upload_media`, `update_location`, `update_categories`, `update_attributes`, `update_service_items`, `update_service_area`, `update_address`, `set_regular_hours`, `set_special_hours` and `set_open_status`. The live set and each action's parameters are whatever `list_actions` returns. New posts follow the social-media-publish skill and review replies follow the social-media-engage skill.

## Reading
1. Call `get_connectors` to pick the location; ask if several are connected.
2. Call `get_fields` for `google_my_business` and use the exact ids it returns.
3. Call `get_data` with the fields, the location and a date range.

Fields that are easy to misread:
- `impressions` is Maps plus Search, desktop plus mobile; the split is in `impressions_desktop_maps`, `impressions_desktop_search`, `impressions_mobile_maps` and `impressions_mobile_search`. `clicks` is `call_clicks` plus `website_clicks`.
- By default, review rows and local post rows cover only reviews and posts created in the requested range. Use a wide range to list older ones.
- `review_average_rating` and `review_count` are limited to the range; `review_average_rating_total` and `review_total_count` are all-time.
- `location_*` fields describe the listing's current state (address, categories, hours, attributes, services, service area).

## Changing the listing
Every change follows read, propose, confirm, execute:
1. Read the current value with `get_data` (the matching `location_*`, `post_*` or `review_*` fields).
2. Call `list_actions` and build params from the schema.
3. Show the current value and the new value side by side, and wait for an explicit yes.
4. Call `execute_action` once and report the result. Google may review listing edits before they appear.

Actions that replace a whole set (resend everything the listing should keep):
- `update_service_items` replaces all services; read `location_service_items` first.
- `update_categories` sets the primary category and replaces every additional category (at most 9); omitting `additional_category_ids` removes them all. Read `location_primary_category_id` and `location_additional_categories` first.
- `update_service_area` replaces all places (at most 20); read `location_service_area` first.
- `set_regular_hours` replaces all weekly hours; a day with no period shows as closed. Read `location_regular_hours_periods` first.
- `set_special_hours` replaces all special dates. Read `location_special_hours_periods` first and resend every upcoming exceptional date the listing should keep together with the new ones.
- `update_attributes` is the exception: it changes only the attributes named.

Actions that can unpublish the listing:
- `update_address`, and `update_service_area` with `hide_business_address=true`, can send the listing back into Google's verification, which may unpublish it until the business verifies again. They refuse to run unless `acknowledge_reverification_risk` is true. State this risk in the confirmation and set it only after the user approves that risk explicitly.
- Run `update_address`, `update_service_area` and `update_location` with `validate_only=true` first when the user is unsure; success means Google accepted the request for validation, not that anything changed.
- `update_address` replaces the whole address. Use `keep_map_pin=true` only when the business has not moved.
- `update_categories` can also trigger re-verification in some cases; say so.

Other notes:
- `upload_media` with category COVER or PROFILE replaces the current cover or profile photo. Photos must be public JPG or PNG URLs, at least 250x250 px and 10 KB.
- `update_location` changes the description (up to 750 characters), website and phone numbers. Additional phone numbers are kept unless `additional_phones` is sent; `[]` removes them.
- `set_open_status` switches between OPEN and CLOSED_TEMPORARILY; it is reversible.
- `reply_to_review` replaces an existing reply.
- If write actions are not enabled for the account, send the user to https://onboard.windsor.ai/app/settings/account.
