# Manage crm

Make confirmed changes on connected crm accounts through Windsor.ai:
create, update, or delete Salesforce records; create or update GoHighLevel contacts and create GoHighLevel invoices; HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, and ActiveCampaign are read-only today, and the live set is whatever list_actions returns. The main connector ids for this area are hubspot, salesforce, pipedrive, gohighlevel, zoho, activecampaign. Other sources in the same category work the same way; find their ids with get_connectors.

## Non-negotiable contract
- Interpret pause, enable, stop, resume, set, raise, lower, update, and change as a write request for this skill.
- Every write follows read, propose, confirm, execute. Never call execute_action without an explicit yes to the specific change.
- The set of actions is whatever list_actions returns for the connector. Do not assume an action exists, and do not improvise a write with a different tool.
- One change per confirmation. For a batch, list every item and get one explicit approval for the exact list.

## Workflow
1. Resolve the target with a get_data read (name plus id fields) so the change points at an id, not a name. If several items match, ask which one.
2. Call list_actions for the connector and build the params from the returned JSON schema.
3. Show the concrete change and ask for confirmation, for example "Pause campaign 'Summer Sale' (id ...) on account ...?" or "Set daily budget for campaign X to 50.00 (50000000 micros)?".
4. After an explicit yes, call execute_action once and report the result, including anything the platform returned.

## Rules that prevent wrong writes
- Resolve the exact record with a get_data read (object, id, key fields) before proposing a change.
- Show old value, new value, object, and record id in the confirmation; write only after an explicit yes.
- If list_actions returns no action for the connector, say so plainly and do not attempt a workaround.
- If the user says "pause the worst one", first run the read and ranking (or hand the ranking to /crm-insights), then name the specific item and confirm before writing.
- If execute_action reports that write actions are not enabled for the account, send the user to https://onboard.windsor.ai/app/settings/account to turn them on, then retry after they confirm.

## Stay in scope
- Reporting without a change -> /crm-insights.
- Creating a record (a Salesforce object, a GoHighLevel contact or invoice) follows the same read, propose, confirm, execute steps in this skill; deleting a Salesforce record cannot be undone, so name the record and its id in the confirmation.
- Connecting or reconnecting an account -> /windsor-connect.

## Answer with evidence
State what changed, on which account and item, and the value before and after. Never claim a change succeeded without the execute_action result.
