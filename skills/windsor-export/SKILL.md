# Export connected data on a schedule

Set up recurring exports of connected data to a warehouse, database, spreadsheet, or cloud storage through Windsor.ai, for example daily ad spend to BigQuery, a weekly GA4 summary to Google Sheets, or Shopify orders to Snowflake.

## Stay in scope
- Use this skill for recurring, scheduled, daily, weekly, or automated exports and syncs, and for questions about existing export tasks.
- A one-off answer is /windsor-insights, not an export.

## Workflow
1. Call get_destination_tasks to see existing exports and avoid duplicates.
2. Call get_connectors to confirm the source connector and accounts to export.
3. Call get_destinations to list destinations; note which have create_in_chat true and any reusable credentials.
4. Call get_destination_setup_info for the chosen destination to get its target fields, allowed schedules, and credential_id options.
5. Call get_fields for the source connector to get the exact field ids to export.
6. Confirm source, accounts, fields, destination target, credential, and schedule with the user, then call create_destination_task once. If create_in_chat is false, hand the user the setup_url instead.

## Rules
- Prefer a rolling date_preset (for example last_7d) over fixed dates so each run stays fresh.
- Never put secrets in config; sensitive values are entered by the user in the setup_url form.
- Report the created task's id, schedule, and manage_url from the tool result.

## Hand-offs
- Reporting -> /windsor-insights. Connecting a source -> /windsor-connect. Changing platform state -> /windsor-manage.
