description: Analyze and manage Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram ad placements) through Windsor.ai. Use when the user asks about their Facebook Ads / Meta Ads performance — pulling live campaign, ad set, or ad metrics (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, CPA, ROAS), comparing date ranges, or finding top or underperforming campaigns — or when they want to create, pause, or enable a campaign, ad set, or ad, change a budget, boost an existing post, or edit ad creative. Do not use for other ad platforms (Google Ads, TikTok, LinkedIn, Microsoft Ads), organic Facebook Page posts or Instagram organic content, or designing/generating ad creative images.

# Facebook Ads via Windsor.ai

Windsor.ai exposes live Meta Ads data (read) and a set of campaign management
actions (write) for Facebook and Instagram ad placements through MCP tools.
The connector id is `facebook`. Pass `facebook` as the connector on every tool call; the Windsor.ai server
serves all connectors, so it is never implied.

This connector covers **Meta Ads** (paid Facebook & Instagram ad placements)
only. It is distinct from Facebook Organic (Page posts) and Instagram
organic, which live in their own connectors — route organic questions there.

Golden rules:

- **Never guess field, account, action, or option names.** They come from
  `get_fields`, `get_connectors`, `list_actions`, and `get_options`. Call those
  first; do not invent identifiers.
- **Reads are safe; writes change live ad spend.** Only call `execute_action`
  after the user has confirmed the specific change.
- Report numbers the user asked for, concisely. Don't dump raw rows unless asked.

## 1. Ground yourself first

Call `get_connectors` to see which Meta Ads accounts are connected (each has
an id and, usually, a name). If none are connected, help the user connect one:
call `get_connector_authorization_url` (or `get_connector_connect_info` for the
auth type and steps) and give them the setup link — do not describe manual
dashboard navigation.

If the user names an account, match it to a connected account id. If several are
connected and the request is ambiguous, ask which account.

## 2. Reading performance data

1. Call `get_fields` for `facebook` to get valid field ids (e.g. campaign,
   ad set, ad, date, spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, purchases — use
   the exact ids returned, not these examples).
2. If the analysis needs attribution windows or other segmentation controls,
   call `get_options` to see the connector's options and valid values (e.g.
   click/view attribution windows).
3. Call `get_data` with:
   - `fields`: the ids you actually need (keep the set small).
   - `accounts`: the target account id(s); omit for all connected accounts.
   - A date range: either `date_from`/`date_to` (`"2026-02-01"`), or
     `date_preset` — `last_7d`, `last_30d`, `last_Xd`/`last_Xw`/`last_Xm`,
     `this_month`, `this_year`, `last_year`. Append `T` to include today
     (e.g. `last_7dT`, `this_monthT`).
   - `options`: only if get_options showed relevant ones.
   - `filters`: optional conditions, e.g. `[["spend", "gt", 100]]`; combine
     with `"and"`/`"or"` and nest as needed.

Common requests → recipe:

- **Overview / trend:** fields `date` + the metrics, over a preset range.
- **By campaign / ad set / ad:** fields campaign/ad set/ad + metrics; sort or
  aggregate in your answer.
- **Best / worst campaign:** pull campaign + the metric, then rank; return only
  what was asked (e.g. just the campaign name) if the user constrained the
  output format.
- **Efficiency:** cost per result = spend ÷ conversions (or purchases); ROAS =
  purchase value ÷ spend. Compute from returned fields; note if the
  denominator is zero.

Watch out: Meta spend fields are in the account currency (state it if known).
If a field the user wants isn't in `get_fields`, say so rather than
substituting a different metric.

## 3. Managing campaigns (write actions)

Meta Ads exposes a set of write actions via `list_actions` / `execute_action`.
Always call `list_actions` first for the exact ids and JSON schemas — treat
the summary below as guidance, not gospel. They cover:

- **Create / structure:** `create_campaign` (Facebook or Instagram, with an
  objective such as OUTCOME_TRAFFIC/OUTCOME_LEADS/OUTCOME_SALES and any
  required `special_ad_categories`; created paused), `create_adset` (in an
  existing campaign, with targeting, optimization goal, and billing event;
  created paused), `create_ad` (in an existing ad set — either a simple
  link-ad builder from page_id/link/message/image_url/call_to_action_type, a
  Click-to-Message ad via `messaging_destination`, or a raw creative spec;
  created paused).
- **Status:** `pause_campaign` / `enable_campaign`, `pause_adset` /
  `enable_adset`, `pause_ad` / `enable_ad`.
- **Budget:** `set_campaign_budget` and `set_adset_budget` (`daily` or
  `lifetime`; setting one budget type replaces the other).
- **Update existing objects:** `update_campaign` (name, bid_strategy,
  special_ad_categories, spend_cap), `update_adset` (name, targeting,
  optimization_goal, bid_amount/bid_strategy, destination_type, end_time),
  `update_ad` (name, creative reference, conversion_domain,
  display_sequence), `update_ad_creative` (edits an ad's copy, headline,
  description, link, image, call-to-action, URL tags, or one carousel card —
  Meta treats creatives as immutable, so this creates a new creative and
  re-points the ad at it).
- **Organic post promotion:** `boost_post` (turn an existing organic Facebook
  or Instagram post into a paid ad in an existing engagement ad set, reusing
  the post as the creative; created paused).
- **Messaging:** `set_page_welcome_message` (set the automated greeting shown
  when someone opens a conversation from a Click-to-Message ad).

Budget and creation mechanics:

- Money amounts are in the account currency's **minor unit** (e.g. cents):
  `5000` means 50.00 — not micros. Convert the user's amount before calling.
- Budget actions (`set_campaign_budget`, `set_adset_budget`, `spend_cap`) set
  an **absolute** value, not a delta. To "raise by 20%", read the current
  value first, compute the new absolute amount, and set that.
- `create_campaign`, `create_adset`, `create_ad`, and `boost_post` all
  produce **paused** objects by default, so nothing spends until the user
  enables it.

Write workflow — every time:

1. Resolve the campaign/ad set/ad to its id (via a `get_data` read on the
   relevant name and id fields if the user gave a name).
2. Build the exact params from the `list_actions` schema.
3. **Show the user the concrete change and ask them to confirm** — e.g.
   "Pause campaign 'Summer Sale' (id 123…) on account 456…?" or "Set daily
   budget for ad set X to €50.00 (5000 in minor units)?".
4. Only after an explicit yes, call `execute_action` and report the result.

If the user says "pause the worst campaign", first do the read + ranking, then
name the specific campaign and confirm before pausing — don't pause on the
strength of the aggregate alone.

## 4. Reference the user's data, don't fabricate

If a tool returns an error (unknown field/connector/account), call the relevant
discovery tool (`get_fields`, `get_connectors`, `list_actions`) and retry with
correct ids. Never fill gaps with made-up numbers or campaign names.
